        We are going to make a simple responsive list of Instagram images and a list of who has liked these images by using the Instagram REST API. We are going to use Bootstrap as responsive framework. The webapp we set up should be scaffolded using Yeoman and the webapp generator.

        Log in / register an Instagram user and go to <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/" target="_blank">Instagram.com/developer</a> to set up an API client.
