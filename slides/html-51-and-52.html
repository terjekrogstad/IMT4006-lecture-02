<h2>HTML 5.1 and 5.2</h2>

<p>From W3C HTML5 2014 plan:</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">we again determine which features are likely to meet the “Public Permissive” CR exit criteria,</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">we create a “stable HTML5.1” draft which includes just those “stable” features, and which omits the remaining “unstable” features</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">we create an HTML 5.2 editor’s draft which is a superset of the stable HTML5.1. “Unstable” features from HTML 5.1 and proposed features may be included in the HTML 5.2 draft. We estimate that the FPWD for HTML 5.2 would be in early 2015.</p>
